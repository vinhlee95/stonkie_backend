      You are a financial analyst. Analyze the revenue trends from the following data:

      FINANCIAL DATA:
      Annual Statements: {annual_income_statements}
      Quarterly Statements: {quarterly_income_statements}

      You are given the following insight:
      {insight.content}

      Generate a report for the insight.

      Follow this JSON format precisely:
        [
            {{
                "type": "text" | "chart",
                "content": "string", // This will be the text insight or a description/title for the chart
                "data": {{...}} | null // This will be the data for the chart if type is 'chart', otherwise null
            }},
            ... // More content blocks
        ]

        For "type": "text", the "content" field should contain the textual insight or analysis, and "data" should be null.

        For "type": "chart", the "content" field should contain a descriptive title or summary of what the chart illustrates. The "data" field should contain a JSON object suitable for generating a chart. This 'data' object should be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a data point or category. Structure this data in a way that is commonly used for charting libraries (e.g., a list of objects with keys for categories/labels and values).

        Here's an example of the 'data' structure for a simple time series chart:
        "data": [
            {{"period": "2023-01", "value": 100}},
            {{"period": "2023-02", "value": 120}},
            {{"period": "2023-03", "value": 110}},
            // ... more data points
        ]

      Provide insights in the described JSON format. Be smart about when to use charts versus text â€“ use charts to show trends or comparisons that are hard to convey in text alone, and use text to explain the charts, provide context, or offer other observations.

      No need to start with "Here's a financial analysis report based on the provided information:".

      Focus on following dimensions. Each dimension should be a title having a separate section in the report. 
      Make sure the title is bold in markdown.

      - Annual revenue growth
      - Quarterly revenue growth
        - Analyze growth patterns, seasonality, and acceleration/deceleration
      - Identify growth drivers and their sustainability and future growth potential
      - Analyze risks to growth sustainability

      Make sure to include the data points and numbers to support the insight.
      Do not make up any numbers that are not present in the financial statements.
      Feel free to include general knowledge about the company and the industry.
      Provide the report in markdown format.
